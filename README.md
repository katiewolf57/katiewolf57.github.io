# Planet Images

This is a site displaying the results of my Programing Cultural Heritage final project. 
It has the planets of the solar system, which the user can click on to be taken to a page that displays all of the images related to that planet in DPLA's and NASA's image holdings. 

You can also click on an image to be taken to that item's record on it's holding institution's website. 

The site's address: katiewolf57.github.io

Here is the repository for the final project: https://github.com/katiewolf57/katiewolf-pch
